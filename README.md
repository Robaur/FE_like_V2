Xteck is the architect of this soft

All the soft is on an Draw.io 

The gameplay main feature: 

As a TpT, the player move all his unite, atk with them, cast some spell or use some skills.

BUT the most importante changement in the gameplay is all unite need have a true persona:


	The first the TRUST stat, an unite obey to you only when the TRUST stat is enouth, however the unite could leave the game and your army. Some time character will ask you to do some thing, if you refuse offen, that will spears us into rethinking there place in the army and decrease their TRUST

	Seconde the BOUND, when an unite are in game, they fight with some oders unite, more over, in the CAMP POV, they can make some action with some other unite. That creat BOUND with others unite. When two unite are BOUNDed they gain an stat's bonus in the puzzel part when they fight one next to an another. 

	Threed is the SOUL, it's some passif skill (not activat by a players actions) but changing some rule and liked with the mind of the caracter, exemple WOOD LOVER increase the caracter stat when this one is on a wood place.

	The fourth is the BRIGADE, that represent the solders on your character. You play a General, your unite are some Captain, BRIGADE are the solders. The BRIGADE have then self stat, school (class) and bonus named LORE. The LORE is unique and are choice by the General when he choice to creat one. This bonus can be an stat bonus or skill (exemple GLORY_BATTLECRY are a LORE which up the CHARACTER's TRUST from 1point).
